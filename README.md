Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Project Overview
This project performs data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to identify patterns affecting passenger survival.

Dataset
- Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster (Kaggle)
- File used: `train.csv`

Tools Used
- Python, Google Colab  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

Key Analysis
- Survival analysis by gender and passenger class  
- Age and fare distribution  
- Correlation analysis  

Key Insights
- Females had higher survival rates  
- 1st class passengers survived more  
- Higher fare increased survival chances  

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of exploratory data analysis in understanding datasets and extracting meaningful insights. The findings from this analysis can be used as a foundation for further machine learning modeling.
